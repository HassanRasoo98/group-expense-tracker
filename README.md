## ü§ñ How AI Tools (ChatGPT) Helped

This project was developed with significant assistance from **ChatGPT (AI Tool)**, which played a key role in:

### 1. DB Planning
- Designing the database schema on supabase.
- Writing queries to create tables in sql editor of supabase.

### 2. API and Server Actions
